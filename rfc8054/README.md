This Proposed Standard defines the COMPRESS capability, an extension to the
NNTP protocol that allows a connection to be effectively and efficiently
compressed between an NNTP client and server.

## Known issues

There are currently no known issues which should be worth the effort to be
taken into account in a revision of this RFC.

It is therefore kept as-is, in its original paginated publication format, and
follows the RFC editorial policies at the time it was published.

For the record, a possible future RFC 8054bis could:
- use the latest editorial style applying to RFC publications;
- fix a verb tense in Section 8.3 ("This registration appears" should be read
instead of "This registration will appear").  Though identified during AUTH48,
the tense was unfortunately only changed in Section 8.2 at that time.
