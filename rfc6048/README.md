# RFC 6048

This Proposed Standard formalizes additional keywords
to the existing LIST capability described in [RFC
3977](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3977#section-7.6): COUNTS,
DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD, and SUBSCRIPTIONS.  It also specifies
additional values returned by the existing LIST ACTIVE command for the status
of a newsgroup: `x`, `j`, and `=` followed by the name of a newsgroup.

You can find an [HTML
version](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6048/) and the [history
of RFC 6048](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6048/history/), along
with the `draft-elie-nntp-list-additions` Internet-Drafts, in the [IETF
Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6048/).

## Support

If you have any question about this RFC, you may ask either via the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Julien-Elie/ietf-work/issues), the
[ietf-nntp mailing-list](https://lists.eyrie.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-nntp)
or the `news.software.nntp` newsgroup.

Errata can be submitted through the [RFC Editor web
site](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata.php).

## Known issues

There are currently no known issues which should be worth the effort to be
taken into account in a revision of this RFC.

It is therefore kept as-is, in its original paginated publication format, and
follows the RFC editorial policies at the time it was published.

For the record, a possible future RFC 6048bis could:
- use the latest editorial style applying to RFC publications;
- fix the outdentation of the example in Section 2.5.3.
