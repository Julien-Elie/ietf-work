<abstract>

<t>This document provides recommendations for improving the security of
   the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) when using Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).  It modernizes the NNTP usage of TLS to be consistent
   with TLS best current practices.  This document updates RFC 4642.</t>

</abstract>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

<t>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) <xref target="RFC3977"/> has
   been using Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>
   along with its precursor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), since at
   least the year 2000.  The use of TLS in NNTP was formalized in
   <xref target="RFC4642"/>, providing implementation recommendations
   at the same time.  In order to address the evolving threat model on
   the Internet today, this document provides stronger recommendations
   regarding that use.</t>

<t>In particular, this document updates <xref target="RFC4642"/> by
   specifying that NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the
   best current practices documented in <xref target="BCP195"/>, which
   currently consists of RFC 7525 ("Recommendations for Secure Use of
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS)").  This includes stronger recommendations regarding SSL/TLS
   protocol versions, fallback to lower versions, TLS negotiation,
   TLS-level compression, TLS session resumption, cipher suites, public
   key lengths, forward secrecy, hostname validation, certificate
   verification, and other aspects of using TLS with NNTP.</t>

<section title="Conventions Used in This Document" anchor="conventions">

<t>Any term not defined in this document has the same meaning as it
   does in <xref target="RFC4642"/> or the NNTP core specification
   <xref target="RFC3977"/>.</t>

<t>When this document uses the term "implicit TLS", it refers to TLS
   negotiation immediately upon connection on a separate port.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119 <xref target="BCP14"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- intro -->

<section title="Updates/Changes to RFC 4642" anchor="changes">

<t>This document updates <xref target="RFC4642"/> in the following
   aspects:

<list style="symbols">

<t>NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD disable TLS-level
   compression (Section 3.3 of RFC 7525 <xref target="BCP195"/>), thus no
   longer using TLS as a means to provide data compression (contrary
   to the Abstract and Section 2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>).</t>

<t>NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD prefer implicit TLS,
   and therefore use strict TLS configuration (Section 3.2 of RFC 7525 <xref
   target="BCP195"/>).  That is to say, they SHOULD use a port dedicated
   to NNTP over TLS and begin the TLS negotiation immediately upon
   connection (contrary to a dynamic upgrade from unencrypted to
   TLS-protected traffic via the use of the STARTTLS command, as Section
   1 of <xref target="RFC4642"/> was encouraging).  Implicit TLS is the
   preferred way of using TLS with NNTP for the same reasons, transposed
   to NNTP, as those given in Appendix A of <xref target="MUA-STS"/>.
   (Note that <xref target="MUA-STS"/> and <xref target="RFC4642"/>
   have one author in common.)</t>

<t>NNTP implementations and deployments MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher
   suites (<xref target="RFC7465"/>); this is contrary to Section 5
   of <xref target="RFC4642"/>, which required them to implement the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 cipher suite so as to ensure that any two
   NNTP-compliant implementations can be configured to interoperate.
   This document removes that requirement, so that NNTP client
   and server implementations follow the recommendations given
   in Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of RFC 7525 <xref target="BCP195"/> instead.
   The mandatory-to-implement cipher suite or cipher suites depend
   on the TLS protocol version.  For instance, when TLS 1.2 is used,
   the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be implemented
   (Section 9 of <xref target="RFC5246"/>).<vspace blankLines="42"/></t>

<t>All NNTP clients and any NNTP server that is known by multiple names
   MUST support the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension defined in
   Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6066"/>, in conformance with Section
   3.6 of RFC 7525 <xref target="BCP195"/>.  It was only a "SHOULD" in
   Section 2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

<t>NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the rules
   and guidelines defined in <xref target="RFC6125"/> and <xref
   target="RFC5280"/> for hostname validation and certificate
   verification.  Part of Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4642"/> is,
   therefore, rationalized in favor of following those two documents.</t>

</list></t>

<t><xref target="detailed-changes"/> of this document gives detailed
   changes with regard to the wording of <xref target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- changes -->

<section title="Recommendations" anchor="recommendations">

<t>The best current practices documented in <xref target="BCP195"/>
   apply here.  Therefore, NNTP implementations and deployments compliant
   with this document are REQUIRED to comply with <xref target="BCP195"/>
   as well.</t>

<t>Instead of repeating those recommendations here, this document mostly
   provides supplementary information regarding secure implementation
   and deployment of NNTP technologies.</t>

<section title="Compression" anchor="compression">

<t>NNTP supports the use of the COMPRESS command, defined in Section
   2.2 of <xref target="RFC8054"/>, to compress data between an
   NNTP client and server.  Although this NNTP extension might have
   slightly stronger security properties than TLS-level compression
   <xref target="RFC3749"/> (since NNTP compression can be activated
   after authentication has completed, thus reducing the chances
   that authentication credentials can be leaked via, for instance, a
   Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack, as described
   in Section 2.6 of <xref target="CRIME"/>), this document neither
   encourages nor discourages the use of the NNTP COMPRESS extension.</t>

</section> <!-- compression -->

<section title="Protocol Versions and Security Preferences"
         anchor="tlsversions">

<t>NNTP implementations of news servers are encouraged to support options
   to configure 1) the minimal TLS protocol version to accept and 2)
   which cipher suites, signature algorithms, or groups (like elliptic
   curves) to use for incoming connections.  Additional options can
   naturally also be supported.  The goal is to enable administrators
   of news servers to easily and quickly strengthen security, if needed
   (for instance, by rejecting cipher suites considered unsafe with
   regard to local policy).</t>

<t>News clients may also support similar options, either configurable
   by the user or enforced by the news reader.</t>

</section> <!-- tlsversions -->

<section title="Server Name Indication" anchor="sni">

<t>The TLS extension for Server Name Indication (SNI) defined in
   Section 3 of <xref target="RFC6066"/> MUST be implemented by all
   news clients.  It also MUST be implemented by any news server that
   is known by multiple names.  (Otherwise, it is not possible for a
   server with several hostnames to present the correct certificate to
   the client.)</t>

</section> <!-- sni -->

<section title="Prevention of SSL Stripping" anchor="sslstripping">

<t>In order to help prevent SSL Stripping attacks (Section 2.1 of
   <xref target="RFC7457"/>), NNTP implementations and deployments
   MUST follow the recommendations provided in Section 3.2 of RFC 7525 <xref
   target="BCP195"/>.  Notably, in case implicit TLS is not used,
   news clients SHOULD attempt to negotiate TLS even if the server
   does not advertise the STARTTLS capability label in response to the
   CAPABILITIES command (Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>).</t>

</section> <!-- sslstripping -->

<section title="Authenticated Connections" anchor="authconnections">

<t><xref target="RFC4642"/> already provides recommendations and
   requirements for certificate validation in the context of checking the
   client or the server's identity.  Those requirements are strengthened
   by <xref target="certverif"/> of this document.</t>

<t>Wherever possible, it is best to prefer certificate-based
   authentication (along with Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   (SASL) <xref target="RFC4422"/>), and ensure that:

<list style="symbols">
<t>Clients authenticate servers.</t>
<t>Servers authenticate clients.</t>
<t>Servers authenticate other peer servers.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document does not mandate certificate-based authentication,
   although such authentication is strongly preferred.  As mentioned in
   Section 2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>, the AUTHINFO SASL command
   (Section 2.4 of <xref target="RFC4643"/>) with the EXTERNAL mechanism
   (Appendix A of <xref target="RFC4422"/>) MAY be used to authenticate a
   client once its TLS credentials have been successfully exchanged.</t>

<t>Given the pervasiveness of eavesdropping <xref target="RFC7258"/>,
   even an encrypted but unauthenticated connection might be better than
   an unencrypted connection (this is similar to the "better-than-nothing
   security" approach for IPsec <xref target="RFC5386"/>, and
   in accordance with opportunistic security principles <xref
   target="RFC7435"/>).  Encrypted but unauthenticated connections
   include connections negotiated using anonymous Diffie-Hellman
   mechanisms or using self-signed certificates, among others.</t>

<t>Note: when an NNTP server receives a Netnews article, it MAY add a
   &lt;diag&#8209;match&gt; (Section 3.1.5 of <xref target="RFC5536"/>),
   which appears as "!!" in the Path header field of that article, to
   indicate that it verified the identity of the client or peer server.
   This document encourages the construction of such Path header fields,
   as described in Section 3.2.1 of <xref target="RFC5537"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- authconnections -->

<section title="Human Factors" anchor="humanfactors">

<t>NNTP clients SHOULD provide ways for end users (and NNTP servers
   SHOULD provide ways for administrators) to complete at least the
   following tasks:

<list style="symbols">
<t>Determine if a given incoming or outgoing connection is encrypted
   using a security layer (either using TLS or an SASL mechanism that
   negotiates a security layer).</t>

<t>Be warned if the version of TLS used for encryption of a given stream
   is not secure enough.</t>

<t>If authenticated encryption is used, determine how the connection
   was authenticated or verified.</t>

<t>Be warned if the certificate offered by an NNTP server cannot be
   verified.</t>

<t>Be warned if the cipher suite used to encrypt a connection is not
   secure enough.</t>

<t>Be warned if the certificate changes for a given server.</t>

<t>When a security layer is not already in place, be warned if a given
   server stops advertising the STARTTLS capability label in response to
   the CAPABILITIES command (Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>),
   whereas it advertised the STARTTLS capability label during any
   previous connection within a (possibly configurable) time frame.
   (Otherwise, a human might not see the warning the first time, and
   the warning would disappear immediately after that.)</t>

<t>Be warned if a failure response to the STARTTLS command is
   received from the server, whereas the STARTTLS capability label was
   advertised.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that the last two tasks cannot occur when implicit TLS is used,
   and that the penultimate task helps prevent an attack known as "SSL
   Stripping" (Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC7457"/>).</t>

</section> <!-- humanfactors -->

</section> <!-- recommendations -->

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">

<t>Beyond the security considerations already described in
   <xref target="RFC4642"/>, <xref target="RFC6125"/>, and <xref
   target="BCP195"/>, the following caveat is worth mentioning when
   not using implicit TLS: NNTP servers need to ensure that they are
   not vulnerable to the STARTTLS command injection vulnerability
   (Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7457"/>).  Though this command
   MUST NOT be pipelined, an attacker could pipeline it.  Therefore,
   NNTP servers MUST discard any NNTP command received between the use
   of STARTTLS and the end of TLS negotiation.</t>

</section> <!-- security -->

<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">

<t>This document does not change the formal definition of the STARTTLS
   extension (Section 6 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>).  Nonetheless,
   as implementations of the STARTTLS extension should follow this
   document, IANA has added reference to this document to the existing
   STARTTLS label in the "NNTP Capability Labels" registry contained in
   the "Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) Parameters" registry:</t>

<section title="Detailed Changes to RFC 4642" anchor="detailed-changes">

<t>This section lists the detailed changes that this document applies to <xref
   target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

<section title="Related to TLS-Level Compression">

<t>The second sentence in the Abstract in <xref target="RFC4642"/>
   is replaced with the following text:

<list>
<t>The primary goal is to provide encryption for single-link
   confidentiality purposes, but data integrity, and (optional)
   certificate-based peer entity authentication are also possible.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The second sentence of the first paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of <xref
   target="RFC4642"/> is replaced with the following text:

<list>
<t>The STARTTLS command is usually used to initiate session security,
   although it can also be used for client and/or server certificate
   authentication.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Related to Implicit TLS">

<t>The third and fourth paragraphs in Section 1 of <xref
   target="RFC4642"/> are replaced with the following text:

<list>
<t>TCP port 563 is dedicated to NNTP over TLS, and registered in the
   IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry for
   that usage.  NNTP implementations using TCP port 563 begin the TLS
   negotiation immediately upon connection and then continue with the
   initial steps of an NNTP session.  This immediate TLS negotiation
   on a separate port (referred to in this document as "implicit TLS")
   is the preferred way of using TLS with NNTP.</t>

<t>If a host wishes to offer separate servers for transit and reading
   clients (Section 3.4.1 of [NNTP]), TCP port 563 SHOULD be used for
   implicit TLS with the reading server, and an unused port of its choice
   different than TCP port 433 SHOULD be used for implicit TLS with the
   transit server.  The ports used for implicit TLS should be clearly
   communicated to the clients, and specifically that no plaintext
   communication occurs before the TLS session is negotiated.</t>

<t>As some existing implementations negotiate TLS via a dynamic upgrade
   from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic during an NNTP session
   on well-known TCP ports 119 or 433, this specification formalizes
   the STARTTLS command in use for that purpose.  However, as already
   mentioned above, implementations SHOULD use implicit TLS on a
   separate port.</t>

<t>Note: a common alternative to protect NNTP exchanges with transit
   servers that do not implement TLS is the use of IPsec with encryption
   <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>An additional informative reference to <xref target="RFC4301"/>
   is, therefore, added to Section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Related to RC4 Cipher Suites">

<t>The third paragraph in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>
   is removed.  Consequently, NNTP no longer requires the implementation
   of any cipher suites, other than those prescribed by TLS (Section 9
   of <xref target="RFC5246"/>), and Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of RFC 7525 <xref
   target="BCP195"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Related to Server Name Indication">

<t>The last two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2
   of <xref target="RFC4642"/> are removed.  Section 3.6 of RFC 7525 <xref
   target="BCP195"/> applies.</t>

</section>

<section title="Related to Certificate Verification" anchor="certverif">

<t>The text between "During the TLS negotiation" and "identity bindings)."
   in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC4642"/> is replaced with the following
   text:

<list>
<t>During TLS negotiation, the client MUST verify the server's identity
   in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  The client MUST follow
   the rules and guidelines defined in <xref target="RFC6125"/>, where
   the reference identifier MUST be the server hostname that the client
   used to open the connection, and that is also specified in the TLS
   "server_name" extension <xref target="RFC6066"/>.  The following
   NNTP-specific consideration applies: DNS domain names in server
   certificates MAY contain the wildcard character "*" as the complete
   leftmost label within the identifier.</t>

<t>If the match fails, the client MUST follow the recommendations in
   Section 6.6 of <xref target="RFC6125"/> regarding certificate pinning
   and fallback.</t>

<t>Beyond server identity checking, clients also MUST apply the
   procedures specified in <xref target="RFC5280"/> for general
   certificate validation (e.g., certificate integrity, signing, and
   path validation).</t>
</list></t>

<t>Additional normative references to <xref target="RFC5280"/>
   (replacing <xref target="PKI-CERT"/>, which it obsoletes), <xref
   target="RFC6066"/>, and <xref target="RFC6125"/> are, therefore, added
   to Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- certverif -->

<section title="Related to Other Obsolete Wording">

<t>The first two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   <xref target="RFC4642"/> are removed.  There is no special requirement
   for NNTP with regard to TLS Client Hello messages.  Section 7.4.1.2
   and Appendix E of <xref target="RFC5246"/> apply.</t>

<t>Improve wording to make clear that the server hostname that the client
   used to open the connection is the same as the one specified in the TLS
   "server_name" extension.</t>
<t>Move <xref target="RFC5280"/>, <xref target="RFC6125"/> and
   <xref target="RFC7525"/> to normative references.</t>
<t>In detailed changes of <xref target="RFC4642"/>, use [NNTP] instead of

<t>Use (and define) the "implicit TLS" terminology instead of "strict TLS".
   The language in <xref target="RFC7525"/> is unfortunate since "strict TLS"
   is not clearly defined in that document, and the name suggests that it is
   an alternative to "opportunistic TLS", rather than an alternative to
   STARTTLS.  While STARTTLS is often used opportunistically, that is not
   always the case.</t>
<t>Mention SSL Stripping in <xref target="humanfactors"/> with a reference
   to Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC7457"/> because the intent of the
   related task may not have been clear enough.  Reported by Matija Nalis.</t>
<t>Add <xref target="sslstripping"/> about how to prevent SSL stripping,
   notably by an attempt to negotiate TLS even if STARTTLS is not advertised,
   when implicit TLS is not used.</t>
<t>Strengthen the requirements on hostname validation and certificate
   verification, by referencing <xref target="RFC6125"/> and <xref
   target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
<t>Ask IANA to add this document to the NNTP capabilily labels registry.</t>
<t>Reference the security considerations of <xref target="RFC6125"/>.</t>
<t>Mention informative and normative references to add to <xref
   target="RFC4642"/>.</t>

<section title="Changes since -01">
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>Take into account all the remarks sent during IETF Last Call.</t>
<t>Move the part about <xref target="RFC4642"/> from Introduction to a new
   dedicated Section named "Updates/Changes to RFC 4642" so as to make
   the document a bit more structured.</t>
<t>The warning about lack of STARTTLS is expanded in scope to say "during
   any previous connection within a (possibly configurable) time frame"
   instead of "during the previous connection".</t>
<t>Remove Appendix about export restrictions on crypto.  It is useless
   since RFC 2804.</t>
<t>Add wording about the use of strict TLS for transit.  Mention the use
   of a port other than 433 for strict TLS between two peers, and add
   a note about a possible use of IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/> for
   transit.  Do not only speak about port 563.</t>
<t>Explicitly mention the mandatory-to-implement cipher suite for
   TLS 1.2.</t>
<t>Do not keep the paragraph about TLS Client Hello messages
   and Server Name Indication (SNI) in <xref target="RFC4642"/>.  Support
   for SNI <xref target="RFC6066"/> is now a MUST, and not a SHOULD.</t>
<t>Reference <xref target="RFC7457"/> for the STARTTLS command injection
   vulnerability.</t>
<t>Add notes to RFC Editor to ask that [MUA-STS] and [NNTP-COMPRESS]
   references be changed to their [RFCxxxx] form, once published, and
   whether [BCP195] should be used instead of [RFC7525].</t>
<t>Move <xref target="RFC5246"/> (TLS) to a normative reference.</t>
<t>Minor other wording improvements.</t>

<t>Clarify in the introduction of <xref target="recommendations"/>
   that NNTP implementations compliant with this document are REQUIRED
   to also comply with <xref target="RFC7525"/>.</t>
<t>Improve the wording of <xref target="tlsversions"/> to mention that
   configuration is primarily intended for news servers.  Also, be more
   consistent in the options to accept, and include signature algorithms
   and named groups.</t>
